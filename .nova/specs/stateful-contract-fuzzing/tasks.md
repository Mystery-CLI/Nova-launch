# Implementation Plan: Stateful Contract Fuzzing

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Alternative Implementation)

The stateful contract fuzzing feature has been successfully implemented in `contracts/token-factory/src/fuzz_test.rs` using an alternative approach that achieves all functional requirements while using a custom deterministic generator instead of proptest strategies.

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Components

✅ **Core Data Structures** (Alternative naming)
- `FuzzAction` enum with all operation variants (Initialize, UpdateFees, GetState, GetTokenCount, GetTokenInfo)
- `StateModel` struct tracking expected contract state (initialized, admin, treasury, fees, token_count)
- Inline result handling (no separate ActionResult enum needed)

✅ **Deterministic Action Generator** (Custom LCG-based approach)
- `ActionGenerator` struct with seed-based deterministic generation
- LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) for reproducible pseudo-random numbers
- `generate_action_sequence()` method producing sequences of 1-100+ actions
- Generates all action types with appropriate parameter ranges
- Includes negative fees for error testing
- Uses address seeds for deterministic address generation

✅ **Action Execution** (Integrated approach)
- `execute_stateful_fuzz()` function executing action sequences
- Maintains `StateModel` tracking expected state
- Address caching for consistent address reuse across actions
- Parallel execution of model and contract operations
- Graceful handling of expected errors (AlreadyInitialized, Unauthorized, NotInitialized)

✅ **Invariant Verification**
- `verify_invariants()` function checking all required invariants:
  - State consistency (base_fee, metadata_fee match between contract and model)
  - Fee non-negativity (base_fee >= 0, metadata_fee >= 0)
  - Token count consistency
  - Fee sum overflow detection
- Descriptive error messages with seed and action context for debugging

✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- `test_stateful_fuzz_short_sequence()` - 10 actions
- `test_stateful_fuzz_medium_sequence()` - 50 actions
- `test_stateful_fuzz_long_sequence()` - 100 actions
- `test_stateful_fuzz_multiple_seeds()` - 10 different seeds with 30 actions each
- `test_initialization_focused_sequence()` - Double initialization testing
- `test_fee_update_focused_sequence()` - Authorization testing
- `test_unauthorized_operations_sequence()` - Uninitialized state handling
- `test_negative_fee_sequence()` - Invalid parameter testing
- `test_interleaved_operations()` - Complex interaction testing

✅ **Replay Capability**
- Seed-based deterministic replay
- Clear error messages with seed information
- Replay test template in `replay_tests` module
- Example: `cargo test test_replay_seed_12345 -- --nocapture`

### Architecture Differences from Original Plan

The implementation uses a **monolithic integrated approach** instead of the originally planned modular architecture:

**Original Plan:**
- Proptest strategies for action generation
- Separate ActionExecutor struct
- Separate check_invariants function
- Property-based tests with automatic shrinking

**Actual Implementation:**
- Custom LCG-based ActionGenerator
- Integrated execution in execute_stateful_fuzz()
- Integrated invariant checking in verify_invariants()
- Manual test cases with specific seeds

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Achieves all functional requirements
- ✅ Provides deterministic reproducibility
- ✅ Tests all operation types and edge cases
- ✅ Validates all required invariants
- ✅ Offers clear replay mechanism
- ✅ Simpler architecture, easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ No external dependencies beyond what's already in use

### Requirements Coverage

All requirements from requirements.md are satisfied:

✅ **Requirement 1: Deterministic Action Sequence Generation**
- Same seed always produces same action sequence (LCG guarantees this)
- Multiple operation types included
- Sequences of varying lengths (10, 30, 50, 100 actions)
- Valid parameter values for each operation
- Both valid and invalid fee values tested

✅ **Requirement 2: Stateful Action Execution**
- StateModel maintains contract state across actions
- Initialization state tracked and respected
- Expected errors handled gracefully
- Model updated only on successful operations
- Authorization tracking via address seeds

✅ **Requirement 3: Invariant Assertion**
- State consistency checked after each action
- Fee non-negativity verified
- Double initialization rejection verified
- Token count non-negativity verified
- Invalid token index rejection verified
- Unauthorized access rejection verified

✅ **Requirement 4: Failure Persistence and Replay**
- Failing seeds captured in error messages
- Seeds output to test output
- Replay commands generated in error messages
- Specific test cases can be created for failing seeds
- Standard Rust test replay format

✅ **Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure**
- Implemented in existing fuzz_test.rs file
- Runs with `cargo test`
- Executes alongside existing property tests
- Follows Rust and Soroban SDK conventions
- Uses standard test framework

✅ **Requirement 6: Comprehensive Operation Coverage**
- Initialize actions with random parameters
- UpdateFees actions with random callers and fees
- GetState actions for state verification
- GetTokenCount actions for registry verification
- GetTokenInfo actions with random indices
- Interleaved operation types in sequences

## Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all stateful fuzz tests
cargo test --lib stateful_tests -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_stateful_fuzz_long_sequence -- --nocapture

# Run with multiple seeds
cargo test test_stateful_fuzz_multiple_seeds -- --nocapture
```

### Replaying Failures

When a test fails, the output includes the seed and a replay command:

```
✗ FAILURE - Replay with seed: 12345
Error: SEED: 12345 | Action 5: UpdateFees(...) | Base fee mismatch: contract=100, model=200

Replay command:
cargo test test_replay_seed_12345 -- --nocapture
```

To replay, create a test in the `replay_tests` module using the template provided.

## Notes

- The implementation achieves all functional requirements through an alternative architecture
- Custom LCG-based generator provides deterministic reproducibility without proptest strategies
- Integrated execution and invariant checking simplifies the codebase
- Manual test cases provide targeted coverage of important scenarios
- Seed-based replay enables efficient debugging of failures
- The approach is simpler to understand and maintain than the originally planned modular architecture
